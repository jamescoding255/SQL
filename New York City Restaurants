--Show the whole table
/*SELECT *
FROM nomnom;*/

--Show the list of neighborhoods
SELECT DISTINCT neighborhood
FROM nomnom;

--Show the cuisine types
SELECT DISTINCT cuisine
FROM nomnom;

FROM nomnom
WHERE cuisine = 'Chinese';

--Show all restaurants with reviews of 4 and above

FROM nomnom
WHERE review >= 4;

SELECT *
FROM nomnom
WHERE cuisine = 'Italian' AND price = '$$$';

SELECT *
FROM nomnom
WHERE neighborhood = 'Midtown' OR neighborhood = 'Downtown' OR neighborhood = 'Chinatown';

SELECT * 
FROM nomnom
WHERE health IS NULL;

ORDER BY review DESC
LIMIT 10;

SELECT *,
CASE
